104,17403,"Bitcoin Price Soars, Fueled by Speculation and Global Currency Turmoil - The New York Times",New York Times,Nathaniel Popper,2017-01-04,2017.0,1.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics  —   highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory  —   has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low  —   under $200  —   in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a   American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. “I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said."
3465,21128,Bitcoin Plunges After Hacking of Exchange in Hong Kong - The New York Times,New York Times,Amie Tsang,2017-02-09,2017.0,2.0,,"HONG KONG  —   The digital currency Bitcoin plunged on Wednesday after Bitfinex, an exchange based in Hong Kong, said it had been hacked and funds stolen. The exchange said it had halted trading, deposits and withdrawals while it investigated which users had been affected. Bitcoin’s trading value fell about 20 percent early on Wednesday, local time in Hong Kong, but had recovered about half the loss by early afternoon. Zane Tackett, Bitfinex’s director of community and product development, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But he said in a posting on Reddit that 119, 756 Bitcoins had been  stolen. Before the hacking was made public, that number of Bitcoins would have been worth about $72 million. Now that the currency has slumped, the figure is closer to $65 million. The exchange, one of the world’s largest, said in a blog post that any outstanding settlements would be made at the price before the hacking. “As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing,   collateral affected by the breach,” Bitfinex said in the post. It added that customers’ losses would be addressed later. Security breaches of this type have raised questions about the viability of Bitcoin. The most notable episode was the collapse in 2014 of Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, in which hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins were stolen in a heist that experts and law enforcement officials are still trying to unravel. This past June, a hacker stole more than $50 million worth of Ether, another digital currency, from an experimental virtual currency project called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Jack Liu, chief strategy officer at OKCoin, a large digital currency exchange, said he was not concerned about the security of his company because it uses a different system. But he noted that there should be more discussion between exchanges over best practices. “We care about the health of the ecosystem,” he said, although he emphasized that nobody should be dictating how Bitcoins are secured. “Hackers are only getting better and so adoption of the same solution may not be the safest for the industry. ” Although some view Bitcoin as the future of finance, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions, the Bitcoin community has been rived with infighting over the development of the technology. The blockchain ledger, part of the coding that underlies the currency, has also gained more mainstream traction, as banks see an opportunity to use the technology to speed up trades. Bitfinex said the theft had been reported to law enforcement."
9827,28563,Venezuelans Using ’Rare Pepes’ and Bitcoin As Currency - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,2017-03-27,2017.0,3.0,,"Internet users in Venezuela have finally quantified what it truly means to have a rare Pepe, buying and selling     trading cards as a way to escape the economic control of their socialist government. [The idea of images of the popular green frog being “rare” started off as a joke on 4chan, where users would claim that their images of Pepe were rarer and more valuable than everyone else’s. It escalated into people selling their collections of Pepe on eBay, with bids reaching up to almost $100, 000 before eBay took it down.  There were never any serious transactions however, with everyone involved enjoying the ironic humour of the situation. More recently, a group of redditors have been “trading” memes of any shape and size on    attempting to create a stock market in meme popularity. But, it turns out that rare Pepe collecting online is now a serious business. Sometime last year, an unknown individual began issuing “official” rare Pepe trading cards using the Counterparty platform to link them to bitcoin, in an attempt to poke fun at another online trading game called Spells of Genesis. Today, these cards can be exchanged for the equivalent of thousands of US dollars on Counterparty’s decentralised exchange. This is due to a creation of artificial scarcity in the cards (as one would expect trading cards to have). Anyone can issue their own rare Pepes, but these are then verified by the official Rare Pepe Foundation, and linked to a certain piece of the bitcoin chain via a practice known as coin colouring. Whomsoever owns that particular bitcoin key address owns the Pepe associated with it. All verified rare Pepes can be viewed in a complete directory of them. This is in particular use in Venezuela. Developers of a game called Rare Pepe Party that would utilise some of these cards have claimed that they are needed to keep their company afloat. “We’re based in Venezuela, and our business has been saved by bitcoin many times,” the developer, who wished to remain anonymous, told Crypto Insider. According to them, around 80% of offices in the vicinity of theirs have been closed down in the past year, with even the biggest businesses still around losing up to 90% of their employees. “In that timeframe, thanks to bitcoin related business, we’ve grown our employee base from just 5 to 10 (we’re still a small company),” said the developer. “We’ve   our office.    we’ve been improving, so we’re banking big on bitcoin and now over Counterparty assets. ” However, bitcoin is not completely safe in the South American nation. Venezuela’s equivalent of secret police, SEBIN, have been targeting people using bitcoin and bringing them up on or extortion and bribes, especially bitcoin miners, according to the developer. “Anything bitcoin related is a big   here at the moment  …     this week I got wind of at least two mining operators getting knocks on their doors. ” Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

14858,33594,Bitcoin Value Crashes by Nearly Twenty Percent - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0,,"Bitcoin value took a dramatic dive Thursday with the cryptocurrency’s value falling by as much as 18% to $820 per coin, according to Business Insider. [Bitcoin made headlines earlier this week when the cryptocurrency value surpassed $1000, its highest valuation since 2013, but Bitcoin traders didn’t enjoy the sudden increase for too long as the price began to fall rapidly. By 8AM EST on Thursday a single coin was valued at $892.   Business Insider claims Bitcoin’s sudden rise in value can be attributed to China where the national currency, the Yuan, has steadily been declining, leading to renewed interest in Bitcoin. The Yuan, however, rose dramatically recently, leading to the devaluation of Bitcoin. Many were surprised by this sudden crash and panicked, leading to more coins being sold off.

99142,146286,Meet the millennials making big money riding China’s bitcoin wave,Guardian,Amy Hawkins,2017-04-11,2017.0,4.0,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/11/meet-the-millennials-making-big-money-riding-chinas-bitcoin-wave,"On a sunny afternoon in west Beijing, on the auspicious eighth floor of a nondescript concrete   Huai Yang sits with the curtains drawn in his apartment, making his own luck. For the past six months,    Yang has worked mainly from home, mainly from his sofa, tracking and trading bitcoin, and watching the money roll in. The flat itself is modestly sized Yang moved in in his   days when he worked variously for a crowdfunder   a branding consultancy and dabbled in   management, all of which he describes as “creative financial work”. Now, though, his main focus is bitcoin, which is “much younger, more fun, and much more money”. Yang claims to make up to 1m yuan (£116, 000) a month, under the radar of the taxman, purely from trading the online cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin has no physical form but the rewards are very tangible Yang’s home is packed full of expensive gadgetry, most prominently a   flat screen smart board, over a metre wide, which Yang uses to chart bitcoin’s rise and fall in HD. Normally, the graphs on Yang’s screen show bitcoin’s and his own fortunes going up and up. At the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth 6, 600 yuan (£768)  —   recent months have seen the value hover well above 8, 000 yuan. The global worth of bitcoin is over $14bn USD (£11. 3bn) of which over 90% is in yuan, and Yang and his peers are cashing in. “I want a more splendid life,” he says. There’s certainly big money to be made in bitcoin, but it comes at a high risk. Bitcoin was designed to be a    currency, free from interference from government and central banks. Since the currency was launched in 2009, however, the Chinese market, where government interventions are common, has come to dwarf all others.  One such intervention took place in February this year, when the government warned that there would be “serious violations” for trading platforms that failed to abide by strict   regulations. In line with this, OKCoin and Huobi. com, the two biggest exchanges in China, announced that they would be suspending bitcoin withdrawals for one month. Incidents like these, which Yang sees as “not convenient, but not [a] problem,” give Chenxing (who asked that I only use his first name) pause for thought. Chenxing, a boyish, skittish 35, has been trading bitcoin for the past four months, after giving up his “too comfortable” job as a   engineer for the government. The government’s pressure on bitcoin platforms is “not so easy to understand,” he tells me. “I’m not sure it’s really about money laundering   …     they try to control [bitcoin] but they cannot”.  For Chenxing, it’s the system itself that is vulnerable: “Technology changes every day,” he explains. “Maybe tomorrow a hacker can find a way to crack bitcoin   …     the security is from mathematics. If you can crack the mathematics, bitcoin is nothing. ” That’s why, even though Chenxing describes himself as a “believer” in bitcoin, he doesn’t plan to stay involved for the long term.  “It’s really not a stable thing,” he says, both in terms of fluctuating prices and the uncertain technological future of the cryptocurrency. That said, he’s still “making more money” than in his previous government job. In a good month, Chenxing will pocket the cash value of around five bitcoin, which is close to 40, 000 yuan, and which Chenxing prefers to have in cold, hard cash. Chenxing is something of an anomaly in Chinese bitcoin circles, where the general mood is one of evangelical faith in the currency’s potential, especially in an economy where the government often devalues the national currency.  Brendan Gibson, 32, is a United States national who has been in China for six years, trading bitcoin for three. We’ve barely sat down to talk when Gibson takes my phone and downloads the BTC Wallet app onto it, before transferring me the seeds of my cryptocurrency fortune: 0. 0027 bitcoin, worth £2. 50, which is the amount that everyone in the world would have if the 21m bitcoin in existence were equally divided up between all 7. 8 billion of us. He believes that “everybody’s aunt   …     or grandma” should be using bitcoin. For Gibson, bitcoin is a way of life. He hopes to be completely bank free in the near future. Hailing from the “shady mortgage industry” of corporate America, Gibson shares Chenxing’s distrustful attitude, but is more concerned about private banks than bitcoin’s technological vulnerability. “I’m just kind of fed up with the system,” he tells me over coffee in a slick café and   space from where Gibson does most of his work remotely.  “I don’t think economies should be built on inflated numbers, and I think it’s kind of ridiculous that everybody relies on this inflated number in their bank account when it’s definitely not there   …     bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are making it so that we are our own banks, and that’s one less things we have to worry about. ” Gibson owns two companies in China, and as far as possible uses bitcoin for all his daily expenses, converting the personal profits he makes into bitcoin to avoid using banks.  One of the commonly cited weaknesses in the bitcoin system is that if you lose your private key to access your bitcoin wallet, the bitcoin within are lost forever. In 2015, it was estimated that up to 30% of all mined bitcoins had been lost, with a value of £625m. Unsurprisingly, plenty of people see this as an opportunity to make some money. Sun Zeyu, 27, works at a tech   based near Beijing’s university district that specialises in bitcoin. His latest project is Coldlar, an offline, physical wallet that stores users’ bitcoin and can be accessed by scanning a QR code. Bitcoin security is a “tough question” Sun tells me, which is why he and his colleagues designed a product that allows people to circumvent bitcoin platforms and have even greater control over their bitcoin. “Now that the value [of bitcoin] is going up,” he explains, “people really realise the importance of security.  Before, when we just traded one or two coins, people didn’t mind, [but] now the value of bitcoin is much bigger”. Sun got involved with bitcoin while at university after attending a seminar run by Huobi, one of the biggest trading platforms in China. Like his flashier friend Yang, Sun wanted money, and lots of it. He won’t tell me exactly how much he earns, but assures me that it’s “hundreds or thousands” times more than the 10, 000 yuan per month he was earning when he first dabbled in bitcoin three years ago.  His money comes from both his trading activity and his company salary. With the growth of bitcoin and related products like his Coldlar wallet, Sun believes that in 10 years’ time, the value of the cryptocurrency will be “one bitcoin, one house in Beijing”. Minor shocks to the system, like the recent suspension of bitcoin withdrawals in China, are “just like breathing,” he insists, and the inhalations of profit dwarf any other bumps in the road. Despite the solitary nature of their work, Yang, Sun, Gibson and Chenxing are all sociable creatures. Gibson is connected to hundreds of bitcoin aficionados in China, and has introduced close to 1, 000 new people to the technology (although how many are like me, with £2. 50 lying dormant in an unused wallet, is unknown) such is his enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency. Chenxing cites the social side of the bitcoin scene in Beijing as one of the main attractions of staying in the industry and the city.  “I can meet some fun people who really love bitcoin   …     I think most of the people who like bitcoin are people who like freedom” he says. Yang, however, takes a slightly   approach. He has little patience for sceptics: “Yes, bitcoin is a risk. Why should I have to discuss these things with [people concerned about the security]? I earn my money, that’s enough. I don’t waste my time explaining bitcoin   …     [if] you’re not my client”. In some ways, Yang concedes, the less people understand bitcoin, the better it is for him. At the moment, the industry is “like an ATM” for him and his peers, and he’s perfectly happy for things to stay that way. In the   world of the   nothing seems to stay the same for long. Whether it’s unpredictable government interventions, or debates within the community about how the industry can and should be scaled, general growth in value thus fair doesn’t necessarily suggest anything about the future of bitcoin, despite the faith of its adherents. Gibson makes the point that bitcoin has only been around for nine years it took PayPal at least 10 to properly catch on.  In Japan it has recently been recognised as legal tender. It’s unlikely that the same could ever happen in China, no matter how much its popularity continues to balloon. Chenxing, who has years of insider experience, is sure that “[the government] will never accept a thing that’s not built by themselves”. Many bitcoin traders in China are in it for the long haul, confident that they can ride out any governmental interferences, as long as they have access to the internet. Chenxing, however, is more paranoid. His final thoughts on bitcoin are: “I never feel secure”."
110488,164687,"From Kill Switch To Bitcoin, ’WannaCry’ Showing Signs Of Amateur Flaws",NPR,Martin Kaste,2017-05-16,2017.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/05/16/528570788/from-kill-switch-to-bitcoin-wannacry-showing-signs-of-amateur-flaws,"Cops have a decent shot at catching     online scammers  —   say, the guy selling a car that’s just too good to be true on Craigslist. But catching ransomware attackers is generally much more difficult  —   unless they slip up. The criminals behind the ”WannaCry” ransomware attack may have done just that. Experts are now seeing some amateur flaws emerging including an    kill switch and the unsophisticated way the attackers are demanding bitcoin from their victims. Ransomware ”tends to be a crime that is born on the Internet, born through kits sold on the dark web that already   in anonymity of the perpetrators,” said police detective Nick Selby, who specializes in cybercrime. Those ”kits” Selby describes are what experts think they’re seeing with WannaCry. Somebody’s using software tools created by somebody else. ”The ransomware itself, we have seen that before in the wild and it’s not that sophisticated,” said Paul Burbage, malware researcher for  . He says the most obvious   is the fact that the malware contained an    ”kill switch”  —   basically, a URL address included in the code, which was used to stop the malware’s spread. ”The kill switch allowed people to prevent the infection chain fairly quickly,” Burbage explained. ”It was kind of a noob mistake, if you ask me.” And WannaCry has other deficiencies. Sophisticated ransomware usually has an automated way to accept payments from victims who want to unlock their computers. But Burbage says WannaCry’s system seems to be manual  —   the scammers have to send each victim a code. Not very practical for an infection involving thousands and thousands of computers. ”It leads me to think they did not think it would spread as far as it is,” he said. ”You know I really think these guys are running scared and they’re probably laying low at this point.” And then there’s this: So far, the scammers have collected payments from fewer than 200 victims. We know this, because they’re demanding bitcoin  —   and bitcoin transactions are public. We don’t know the scammers’ names, but we know the bitcoin addresses they’re using to receive payment  —   just three addresses. Again, more sophisticated ransomware would have the ability to generate a unique bitcoin address for each victim. So far, the attackers have collected about $60, 000 worth of bitcoins which are just sitting there untouched, according to Jonathan Levin,   of Chainalysis, a company that analyzes bitcoin usage to identify  . He’s been watching the bitcoins accumulating at WannaCry’s three addresses. ”It might be that they don’t have a good idea yet about how to launder the bitcoin,” he said. ”Perhaps they’re not really set up to take advantage of the success of their campaign so far.” Levin says one way to turn dirty bitcoin into   money is to do the conversion in a jurisdiction where financial authorities will turn a blind eye. So scammers sometimes have    —   usually their home country  —   where their malware doesn’t do any damage. He gives the example of a very successful ransomware called ”locky,” which favors Russia. ”So if it detects Russian language on the machine, it actually does not execute and deletes itself,” he said. WannaCry, in contrast, doesn’t seem to be playing geographic favorites that way. Two cybersecurity firms now say they’ve found some technical similarities between the WannaCry ransomware and earlier attacks from hackers in North Korea, though they’re not calling the clues proof that North Korea is behind the worldwide attacks.

119314,175528,"Bitcoin jumps above $1,000 for first time in three years",Reuters,Jemima Kelly,2017-01-02,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin-idUSKBN14M0IF  ," Digital currency bitcoin kicked off the new year by jumping above $1, 000 for the first time in three years late on Sunday, having outperformed all    currencies with a 125 percent climb in 2016. Bitcoin   a   ”cryptocurrency” that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system   jumped 2. 5 percent to $1, 022 on the   Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.   Though the digital currency has historically been highly volatile   a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1, 100, before a hack on the   Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks   it has in the past two years been more stable.  Its biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent.  Bitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency’s weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China. Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China’s.  It is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed   bank notes from circulation in November. ”The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,” said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and   of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges. Though bitcoin is still some way off the   high of $1, 163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation   12. 5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a   above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.

119386,175680,Bitcoin plunges as much as 20 percent as Chinese yuan soars,Reuters,Jemima Kelly,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin-idUSKBN14P1ID  ," A dramatic rally in digital currency bitcoin came to a spectacular end on Thursday with a plunge of up to 20 percent as China’s yuan rose sharply   further evidence of an intriguing   inverse relationship between the pair. Bitcoin had gained more than 40 percent in two weeks to hit a   high of $1, 139. 89 on Wednesday, just shy of its    record of $1, 163 on the   Bitstamp exchange  . But it dived as low as $885. 41 on Thursday as the yuan jumped by over 1 percent in offshore trading and headed for its strongest   performance on record.   [ ] Chinese exchanges have reported high volumes of trading of the   ”cryptocurrency” over the past year, during which time the yuan has shed almost 7 percent, its worst annual performance since 1994, while bitcoin has surged 125 percent, outperforming all other currencies for a second year in a row. Bitcoin can used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously, and operates outside the control of any central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as in China, and also to investors who are worried about a devaluation in their currency.  ”Given that the yuan’s weakness over recent months seemed to correlate with bitcoin’s strength more than any other currency, it’s no surprise that bitcoin traders have reacted the way they have to the yuan’s sudden strength today,” said Paul Gordon,    of   Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for investors to access digital currency exchanges.  Exchanges in China say they account for more than 90 percent of global bitcoin trading, which would help explain why a shift  in Chinese demand would sharply affect the price. But many bitcoin experts say Chinese exchanges overstate their volumes in the digital currency, and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U. S.  hedge funds. Some said bitcoin’s fall was a natural reaction to the speed of its previous rise. It is still up more than 50 percent on three months ago, when it was trading at around $600,  ”If something goes up very rapidly. ..people make a lot of money, and at some point they’re going to want to sell, in order to realize their gains,” said Marco Streng, CEO of bitcoin mining and trading firm Genesis Mining.       By 1645 GMT (11:45 a. m. ET) bitcoin had recovered some of its earlier losses to trade down almost 15 percent on the day at around $950, still leaving it on course for its worst performance in a year.  On some digital currency exchanges   of which there are dozens   bitcoin did reach record highs late on Wednesday. ”Once we broke through the nominal   high, liquidity dried up   no shorts, no sellers, which means a volatile little bubble formed quickly,” said Peter Smith, CEO of   Blockchain, the biggest bitcoin   globally.   ”We are seeing the effects of that now as it breaks. It’s still fairly thin trading volume though, so who really knows where it goes next.”  For a graphic on the bitcoin economy, click  %20ECONOMY%20T. jpg For a graphic on bitcoin exchange rates, click   (Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Mark Trevelyan) AMSTERDAM TomTom NV, the Dutch maker of navigation software for cars, on Wednesday said it had struck a deal with Chinese internet company Baidu to collaborate on digital maps used for   driving.

119474,175904,Bitcoin exchange operator pleads guilty in U.S. case tied to JPMorgan hack,Reuters,Nate Raymond,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-jpmorgan-idUSKBN14T1TH  ," A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that he conspired to operate an illegal bitcoin exchange, which prosecutors said was owned by an Israeli who oversaw a massive scheme to hack companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co( ). Anthony Murgio, 33, entered his plea in federal court in Manhattan to three counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, a month before he was to face trial. Under a plea agreement, Murgio agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of about    years in prison or less. U. S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled his sentencing for June 16. The Tampa,   is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Murgio operated Coin. mx, which without a license exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin, including for victims of ransomware, a computer virus that seeks payment, often in the virtual currency, to unlock data it restricts. Prosecutors said Coin. mx was operated from 2013 to 2015 through several fronts, including one called ”Collectables Club,” to trick financial institutions into believing it was a   group interested in collectables like stamps. Coin. mx was owned by Israeli citizen Gery Shalon, according to prosecutors, who say he and   Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies. An attack on JPMorgan resulted in the information of more than 100 million people being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Murgio, who was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, was tied not only to Shalon but also to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio called Aaron ”my friend” and said he ”showed me the ropes to online marketing.” Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U. S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin. mx, including Murgio’s father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. The case is U. S. v.

Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin. mx’s platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and   of a   credit union. But U. S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross’ lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U. S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while ”reporting another potential fraud” to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their    new witness. ”It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess,” she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin. mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon. Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people’s information. Prosecutors said Coin. mx operated through a front called ”Collectables Club” to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev’s help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150, 000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio’s takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union’s board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

120828,178655,Bitcoin hits all-time high as talk of U.S. ETF approval intensifies,Reuters,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,2017-03-03,2017.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-value-idUSKBN16A2FG  ," Digital currency bitcoin hit a record high on Friday on optimism about the approval of the first U. S. bitcoin   fund by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ”There’s one catalyst at the moment and that is the expectation that the Winklevoss Trust will be approved on the 11th of March. That’s the only game in town,” said Daniel Masters, portfolio manager of   Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program.  Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have a pending application with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF, which was filed nearly four years ago. On March 11, the twins are expected to receive a final decision from the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission on whether they can list their ETF. If approved by the SEC, this would be the first bitcoin ETF issued by a U. S. entity. On Friday, bitcoin climbed to a record $1, 298 on the BitStamp platform. Bitcoin last traded at $1, 263. 01, up nearly 5 percent on the day. So far this year, bitcoin has surged more than 30 percent. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for a central authority. Darin Stanchfield, founder and chief executive officer of bitcoin wallet KeepKey, said the approval of the Winklevoss ETF would be a big boost to the market. ”It should add a fair amount of liquidity to the bitcoin market,” added. To date, there are two other bitcoin ETF applications with the SEC. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, backed by early bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group, filed its application with the SEC in March last year. SolidX Partners Inc, a U. S. technology company that provides blockchain services, also filed its ETF application in July of last year. Bitcoin relies on   ”mining” computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Analysts said the groundwork for bitcoin gains was laid in July last year in a process called ”halving,” where rewards offered to bitcoin miners shrink. That has constrained the supply of the digital currency. Dan Morehead, chief executive officer at hedge fund Pantera Capital, said in his recent letter to investors that the bitcoin price moves in line with the currency’s use in transactions and both have risen sharply.  He sees the bitcoin price possibly rising to $2, 288 by the end of the year.

120935,178891,Investors chained to bitcoin bets as U.S. ETF decision looms,Reuters,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Trevor Hunnicutt,2017-03-08,2017.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-etf-winklevoss-idUSKBN16F2SD?il=0  ," Investors are betting market regulators will approve what would be the first U. S.   fund to track the price of  bitcoin. From investment funds to wealthy individuals and even a Las Vegas strip club, the bitcoin ETF is generating a lot of buzz for a financial product. The surge in interest in the digital currency is driving upbeat outlooks from several gauges of investor sentiment on the proposed fund.    Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have an application with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the digital currency ETF, which was filed nearly four years ago. The twins are expected to receive by March 13 the final decision on whether they can list their ETF on the Bats Exchange.    ”We have spoken to a number of our investors, particularly from the U. S. who have indicated to us that they have been buying bitcoin,” said Daniel Masters, portfolio manager of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund Plc. ”They think the Winklevoss ETF and other bitcoin ETF listings will succeed.” If the SEC approves the listing, it would lend legitimacy to an asset that has been the province of enthusiasts and lay speculators. It could pave the way for other ETF listings and unleash the flow of institutional money. The Legends Room, a Las Vegas strip club where bitcoin is accepted as payment for all services, is hardly institutional money, but it has been following the Winklevoss ETF. ”We are already supporters and expect to be investors as well,” said Legends Room founder Nick Blomgren. ”Good opportunities to expand the market for digital currency are rare but they are possible.” So far this year, bitcoin has surged more than 20 percent, largely due to speculation about the Winklevoss ETF, hitting a record high near $1, 300 last Friday  . On Wednesday, however, it dropped below $1, 200. Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, said at least $300 million could flow into the fund in the first week of trading if the Bitcoin ETF gets approved. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? A contract created by Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, to bet on the SEC’s decision showed a 50 percent probability of approval on Tuesday, said BitMEX’s chief executive, Arthur Hayes, compared to 34 percent late last month.  Another metric gauging investor sentiment on the bitcoin ETF ruling is GBTC, the Bitcoin Investment Trust ( ) backed by Grayscale Investments LLC, which does not trade on public exchanges. Historically, GBTC has traded at an average of between a   percent premium to its officially calculated value. The consensus is that the premium on GBTC shrinks if investors believe the bitcoin ETF will be approved by the SEC because they expect a better product to replace it. GBTC premiums have dropped since the beginning of the year, Grayscale data showed. By February, the premium shrunk to single digits. Late on Monday, however, the premium has recovered modestly to 16. 44 percent. But strong interest has not convinced investors such as Michael Venuto, chief investment officer at Toroso Investments LLC, which holds bitcoin investments in some client portfolios. ”This could pop the market and I don’t want to be anywhere near it,” Venuto said of the ETF. ”If you’re going to buy this, it’s a   thing and speculating is a bad idea.”  (Reporting by Gertrude   and Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Megan Davies and Leslie Adler) RIO DE JANEIRO Gun violence is on the rise in Rio de Janeiro, with the sound of firefights echoing daily across Brazil’s seaside city as drug gangs battle each other and police officers patrolling slums.

S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday denied a request to list what would have been the first U. S.   fund built to track bitcoin, the digital currency. Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been trying for more than three years to convince the SEC to let it bring the Bitcoin ETF to market. CBOE Holdings Inc’s Bats exchange had applied to list the ETF. The digital currency’s price plunged, falling as much as 18 percent in trading immediately after the decision before rebounding slightly. It last traded down 7. 8 percent to $1, 098. Bitcoin had scaled to a record of nearly $1, 300 this month, higher than the price of an ounce of gold, as investors speculated that an ETF holding the digital currency could woo more people into buying the asset. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. Yet bitcoin presents a new set of risks to investors given its limited adoption, a number of massive cybersecurity breaches affecting bitcoin owners and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.  ”Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,” the SEC said in a statement. ”The commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated   markets of significant size may develop.” The regulators have questions and concerns about how the funds would work and whether they could be priced and trade effectively, according to a financial industry source familiar with the SEC’s thinking. ”We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through,” said Tyler Winklevoss, CFO of Digital Asset Services LLC. ”We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.” The Winklevoss twins are best known for their feud with Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg over whether he stole the idea for what became the world’s most popular social networking website from them. The former Olympic rowers ultimately settled their legal dispute, which was dramatized in the 2010 film ”The Social Network.” Since then they have become major investors in the digital currency, which relies on ”mining” computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Solutions to the puzzle come roughly every 10 minutes. Advocates of the currency and the technology it relies on to document transactions, blockchain, were dismayed by the ruling. ”How do we develop   and regulated markets in the U. S. and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like bitcoin?” asked Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, an advocacy group. Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, said bitcoin’s price could fall as much as 20 percent but that its   adoption will continue. A Bats spokeswoman said the exchange is reviewing the SEC’s statement and would have no further comment. There are two other bitcoin ETF applications awaiting a verdict from the SEC. Grayscale Investments LLC’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, backed by early bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group, filed an application last year. SolidX Partners Inc, a U.

Having soared to an   high of $1, 350   on the Bitstamp exchange on March 10, on speculation that regulators could approve the first U. S. bitcoin exchange traded fund the following day, the digital currency then slipped back.  Its falls began accelerating on Thursday and it hit a   low of $944. 36 on Saturday. But bitcoin recovered a little on Sunday and built on those gains on Monday, climbing around 2. 5 percent to roughly $1, 050 by 1815 GMT.  Bitcoin experts said its steep losses were driven by a longstanding, and intensifying, row over whether   and how   to increase the capacity of the ”blocks” that bitcoin transactions are processed in, so as to make sure there are no delays in transactions being finalised.  ”The bitcoin scaling debate is a risk for the network and highlights core issues in terms of governance and this is where more nimble crypto competitors see advantages in fleshing out their capabilities sooner,” said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency analysis website Crytocompare, in London.      At the same time that bitcoin was plunging, a newer, rival ”cryptocurrency” was soaring: ether. The digital currency behind Ethereum   a project that some experts say holds more potential than bitcoin   has almost tripled in value this month, jumping to record highs of around $45.  Some experts said traders were selling bitcoin and buying ether, which was exacerbating the falls in the original cryptocurrency.  ”Traders in the space are looking for better returns in the more risky and nascent cryptos such as Dash, Monero and Ethereum (and are) looking to replicate the extraordinary returns that bitcoin saw in its early days,” added Hayter.

Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by someone   or some group   calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.  Money is sent from one anonymous online ”wallet” to another with no need for a third party to validate or clear the transactions. In the WannaCry attack, the addresses of three anonymous bitcoin wallets were given to victims, with a demand for ransom payments from $300 worth of bitcoin, with a promise the affected machines would be decrypted in return, a promise that no evidence has shown will be kept. But since the way that Bitcoin functions is via the blockchain   a giant, virtually   shared ledger of all bitcoin transactions ever made   payments can be traced, if users do not have the sophistication to take further steps to cloak themselves using digital anonymity tools.  ”In the initial days of bitcoin, people. ..didn’t realise they were recording for posterity on the blockchain every financial transaction that ever took place,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University. Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, but users can be traced through IP addresses or by analysing money flows. If criminals using bitcoin want to stay truly anonymous, Gun Sirer said, they have to go through a number of additional, complex steps to make sure they do not get caught.  It is not yet clear what level of sophistication the WannaCry hackers have when it comes to laundering their cryptocurrency, as none of the money has yet been moved out of the three bitcoin wallets linked to the ransomware, which have had over $80, 000 worth of bitcoin paid into them so far. [ ] But some have suggested that the fact that the WannaCry hackers demanded bitcoin shows how amateur they are.  ”If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,” said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a   security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U. S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients. Wilson, who used to work at the FBI, where he set up a taskforce to investigate the use of virtual currencies, did not disclose all the ways that Elliptic and law enforcement agencies find criminals using bitcoin. But sometimes, he said, the offenders make as obvious a mistake as withdrawing money from a bitcoin wallet directly into their bank accounts.     GAME  More sophisticated criminals use obfuscation methods that make it very hard to be tracked down. One of the most basic ones is a technique known as ” ” whereby money is moved from one cryptocurrency into another, across digital currency exchanges   the   the better   to create a money trail that is almost impossible to track.   Newer and more complex   methods have also emerged in recent years, which make it very difficult for law enforcement and bitcoin security firms such as Elliptic or    Chainalysis to track down cybercriminals.  ”It’s a    game  —   as police and companies like Elliptic catch up to criminals’ techniques, they invent new techniques,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington, D. C.  Coin Center, a    advocacy group focusing on public policy issues around cryptocurrency.  These techniques are not foolproof, however     for example, relies on unregulated exchanges that do not carry out    (KYC) checks, and security firms say they will develop ways to trace such methods.  MONERO HACK Easier, perhaps, would be for cybercriminals to use   cryptocurrencies that have   anonymity from the start, such as Monero, Dash and  .  And indeed, experts said late on Tuesday that a computer virus that exploits the same vulnerability as the WannaCry attack had latched on to more than 200, 000 computers and begun using them to manufacture   or ”mine”   Monero currency. But with a total value of around $425 million   a little over 1 percent of that of bitcoin   converting that currency into spendable cash might not be so easy, and it is also much harder for victims to access, alternative payments experts said. That is why the Monero attack did not demand a ransom, but rather used the infected computers’ computing power to create new currency. ”This used to happen in bitcoin before it became big  —   there were loads of botnets that went into computers that used to mine bitcoin, but you now can’t basically mine bitcoin on normal computers because you need specialist hardware,” said Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin.  Levin said such   attacks were carried out several years ago, when mining it was still largely a hobby for tech geeks using their home computers. As the bitcoin price has risen and as transaction numbers have grown, the computers have become so specialized that only they can only perform the function of bitcoin mining. ”If Monero does become adopted and is as big and liquid (as bitcoin) that means the crime (will) move from using computers to mine to getting to extortion,” Levin said.   FRANKFURT German auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.

123010,183188,"Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin",Reuters,Minami Funakoshi and Joyce Lee,2017-06-02,2017.0,6.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-asia-idUSKBN18T0K2  ," Long the preserve of geeky enthusiasts, bitcoin is going mainstream in Asia, attracting Mrs Watanabe   the metaphorical Japanese housewife investor   South Korean retirees and thousands of others trying to escape   savings rates by investing in the cryptocurrency. Asia’s moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin’s 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period. Even after a tumble from last week’s record $2, 779. 08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone   driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year. (For a graphic on bitcoin economy click  )  Over the last two weeks, and encouraged by Japan’s recognition of bitcoin as legal tender in April, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough   rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out. ”After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” said Mutsuko Higo, a    Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200, 000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings. ”Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore,” she said. ”This worries me, so I started bitcoins.” Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region’s thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap. ”Right now, it’s a form of speculation, like stocks,” said Park   a    South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2, 700) of bitcoin. ”I don’t think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.” The risks, though, are rising too. Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy. In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchanges operate under money service operator licenses   like money changers   while in South Korea they are regulated similar to online shopping malls, trading physical goods. Often there are no rules on investor protection. BITCOIN WHEN YOU DIE Park and Higo were drawn into bitcoin by friends. Others are attracted through seminars, social media groups and blogs penned by amateur investors. Noboru Hanaki, a    Japanese web marketer and bitcoin investor, said his personal finance blog gets around 30, 000 page views each month. The most popular post is an explanation of bitcoin, he said, noting that when the bitcoin price surged last month, readership of the article doubled. Rachel Poole, a Hong   kindergarten teacher, said she read about bitcoin in the press, and bought five bitcoins in March for around HK$40, 000 ($5, 100) after studying blogs on the topic. She kept four as an investment and has made HK$12, 000   trading the fifth after classes. ”I wish I’d done it earlier,” she said. Not everyone’s making money.  The bitcoin frenzy has spawned scams, with police in South Korea last month uncovering a $55 million cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that sucked in thousands of homemakers, workers and   businessmen seduced by slick marketing and promises of wealth. Seminars in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong promote similar   marketing schemes that require investors to pay an upfront membership fee of as much as $9, 000. Members are encouraged to promote the cryptocurrency and bring in new members in return for some bitcoins and other benefits. One such Tokyo scheme offered   shopping websites that accept bitcoin,   assistance for car and computer problems, and   gifts when a member gets married, has a baby   or even dies, according to marketing materials seen by Reuters. Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and a bitcoin investor, warned amateur investors against speculating in the digital currency. ”Trading carries huge risk: there is no investor protection and plenty of market manipulation and insider trading. Some of the exchanges cannot be trusted in my opinion.” Some larger exchanges have voluntarily adopted security measures and compensation guarantees, according to their websites, although there are dozens of smaller platforms operating more or less unchecked. In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has set up a task force to explore regulating cryptocurrencies, but it has not set a timeline for publishing its conclusions, an official there said. In Japan   where memories are still fresh of the spectacular 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time   the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it supervises bitcoin exchanges, but not traders or investors. ”The government is not guaranteeing the value of cryptocurrencies. We are asking for bitcoin exchanges to fully explain the risk of sharp price moves,” an FSA official said. Some professional investors say bitcoin can be a useful hedge to help diversify a portfolio, but investors should be cautious. ”This is an extremely volatile and innovative asset class,” said Pietro Ventani, managing director of APP Advisers, an asset allocation strategy firm.

123670,184576,Bitcoin exchange operator tied to hacks gets five-and-a-half years U.S. prison,Reuters,Jonathan Stempel,2017-06-27,2017.0,6.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-jpmorgan-murgio-idUSKBN19I2JM  ," A Florida man was sentenced on Tuesday to    years in prison after pleading guilty to operating an illegal bitcoin exchange suspected of laundering money for hackers and linked to a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Anthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The sentence was roughly half as long as prosecutors had sought. Murgio and   were accused of processing millions of dollars from 2013 to 2015 into the virtual currency bitcoin through the unlicensed exchange Coin. mx. Prosecutors said many transactions were conducted by victims of ransomware, a malicious software that locks up data unless people pay ”ransom” to unlock it. Cyber criminals often demand ransom paid in bitcoin. The alleged schemes also involved the takeover of a   New Jersey credit union to shield their activity. ”Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,” and constructed on a ”pyramid of lies,” U. S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said during the sentencing hearing. Murgio unsuccessfully fought back tears and lost his composure several times in expressing ”enormous regret” for his crimes, which the judge credited as genuine. ”I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people,” Murgio said. ”Believing what I was doing was OK did not make it OK.” Nathan cited Murgio’s generosity to friends and support to his family in imposing a term below the 10 to    years recommended by prosecutors and federal guidelines. Murgio’s lawyer Brian Klein said he was pleased with the reduction, after telling the judge that Murgio had taken responsibility for his ”grievous decisionmaking.” In contrast, Assistant U. S. Attorney Eun Choi faulted Murgio’s dealings with ransomware victims, saying: ”He exploited their desperation to personally profit from them.” A hearing on restitution and forfeiture was set for Sept. 1. Murgio’s father, Michael, pleaded guilty last October to an obstruction charge tied to the credit union. Nine people have been criminally charged following an investigation into the JPMorgan breach, which exposed more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Coin. mx was owned by Gery Shalon, who pleaded not guilty to U. S. charges after being extradited last June from Israel. In March, a jury in Manhattan convicted Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross of scheming to conceal Coin. mx’s activities from banks and regulators. They have yet to be sentenced. The case is U. S. v. Murgio et al, U. S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No.   . NAIROBI Kenya started selling another 1 billion shillings ($9. 64 million) worth of bonds via mobile phone on Friday after an initial 150 million shillings issued sold out in days. LONDON The financial regulator has begun a study of how Britain’s high street banks make money and said the initial findings due next year would help determine if their approach had to be changed. "
130754,196756,Why Bitcoin lost 15 percent of its value in a few minutes,Vox,Timothy B. Lee,2017/3/10,2017.0,3.0,http://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/3/10/14888744/bitcoin-etf-rejected-crash," The value of bitcoins plunged more than 15 percent on Friday afternoon after the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application to create the first   fund (ETF) for Bitcoin. The proposal would have made it easier for ordinary investors to buy bitcoins, but the SEC is worried that these investors could be cheated in the largely unregulated Bitcoin marketplace.    The ruling has been closely watched in the Bitcoin world. A favorable ruling would have given the cryptocurrency a stamp of approval from an influential regulator, and it also could have sparked a surge in Bitcoin’s price as it provided an easier way for people to invest in this exotic new asset class. An ETF provides a way for people to buy an asset or a group of assets as if it were a single stock. There are ETFs that let people invest in gold, wheat, and every stock in the S&P 500. Right now, investing in Bitcoin is a cumbersome process that creates the risk of having your wealth stolen by hackers. A Bitcoin ETF could simplify the process, allowing anyone to invest in Bitcoin using an ordinary brokerage account. The proposed Bitcoin ETF was the brainchild of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who once sued Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea behind Facebook from them when they were all students at Harvard. After settling that lawsuit for millions of dollars worth of Facebook stock, the brothers began investing in Bitcoin startups. They announced plans to create a Bitcoin ETF in 2013, and their proposal has been working its way through the SEC ever since.    But the SEC wasn’t impressed with the proposal. The law requires the SEC to make sure that a newly traded asset existed in a   market that adequately protects people from manipulation and fraud. But the SEC saw little evidence that these conditions were met. Bitcoin is primarily traded in unregulated markets located overseas, especially in China, and as a result, the price of bitcoins is extremely volatile. In the SEC’s view, Bitcoin exchanges are not yet mature enough to justify opening them to the general public. “This creates a    problem,” says Jerry Brito of the   Coin Center. “How do we develop   and regulated markets in the US and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?” The ruling hammered bitcoin’s value. In the minutes after it was published, the value of one bitcoin fell from $1, 290 to less than $1, 000. As I write this, it’s back up to $1, 100, about 15 percent below its value before the ruling was announced:            Analysts expected that SEC approval for the Winklevoss proposal would send Bitcoin’s price soaring, as millions of ordinary investors suddenly had an easy way to buy into the Bitcoin market. That expected rise was likely priced into Bitcoin’s price ahead of the SEC ruling, which would explain why a negative ruling led to a plunging value for the cryptocurrency.    Even after the latest turmoil, however, Bitcoin’s value is way above its level in the past couple of years. A year ago, you could buy one Bitcoin for only about $400. Now it’s almost three times that value. "
