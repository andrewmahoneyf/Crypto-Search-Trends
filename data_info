We used data from GitHub user JesseVent's "crypto" repository, which containeds historical cryptocurrency prices and market data for all different cryptocurrency tokens. Additionally, we used Google Trends data related to our selected cryptocurrencies. We then pulled all of the data ranging back to the start of 2017, as cryptocurrency activity has been more prominent (and arguably more interesting) recently than ever before, due to rising popularity and a heightened sense of legitimacy from the public.
